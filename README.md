# Auto Docking Vessels

This project presents a Webots simulation environment and a vision-based  autonomous docking algorithm for robotic vessels with a novel latching system that enables robotic boats to create dynamic united floating infrastructure while overcoming water disturbances. 

This project is fonded by China National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program.
